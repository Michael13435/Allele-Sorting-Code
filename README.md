# Allele-Sorting-Code
This code will sort raw output from STRait razor, according to a stutter threshold. Some bugs may still exist. Some additional output may need to be deleted

This code may produce additional output beside the main output.
This code takes about 3hrs to run on 300 files with 10000 lines. If you want to use it I suggest trying it on a single file first

There may be some bugs, so be aware of that when using it. I have found it to be pretty consistent, the results were consistent with 185 files worth of data,
though that was an older version of the program.

Hopefully this is able to help you if you found this somehow. I wrote it for a friend who was tasked with manually reviewing about 1,000 files of 10,000 lines of data
as part of a thesis, so that is basically the crowd this is aimed at.
